hello!
this is Spiner (yes the name comes from the fidget spinner) a
package/project manager.
it still in beta. so be aware that bugs and problems might exist.
if you found one please put it in the issue tab.


i already made a Unix-like and Windows build in the Build Directory.
but you can make a custom build too!.

heres how to do it:
    use python to run cmp.py file with two arguments like this:
        `python3 cmp.py {YourPlatform[Unix/Windows]} {BuildName}`
    in the end you can put the buildDirectory with your BuildName on it anywhere, also remember to add the Spiner.bat or Spiner.sh to your path so you can access it from anywhere
